# VidSave

A Lightweight YouTube-to-MP3 App

BACKGROUND

This app is a replacement for the YouTube-To-MP3 websites commonly found on the internet, where one may be bombarded with adware and long wait times. It accepts a URL to a specific YouTube video and extracts the audio, saving it as an MP3 file in a destination of your choosing (Or in the root directory if unspecified). This bot is written in Python, and in order to make it as efficient, instant, and non-intrusive as possible, this app is extremely lightweight. It makes use of  the dependency pytube to locate and download these videos. Currently, this app is able download videos of any length, but does not currently have the capability to download multiple videos at once (i.e. from a playlist).
