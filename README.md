# VidSave

A YouTube-to-MP3 Script


BACKGROUND

This is a replacement for the YouTube-To-MP3 websites commonly found on the internet, where one may be bombarded with adware and long wait times. It accepts a URL to a specific YouTube video and extracts the audio, saving it as an MP3 file in a destination of your choosing (or in the root directory if unspecified). This project is written in Python, and makes use of the dependency pytube to locate and download these videos. Currently, this app is able to work with videos of any length, but does not have the capability to download multiple videos at once (i.e. from a playlist).

If you use MacOS and the MP3 is not importing to Music, a potential solution is to open the MP3 in QuickTime Player and use File -> Export As -> Audio Only. This will save the MP3 as an M4A, which is more agreeable to import into the native Music app.
