# VidSave

A Lightweight YouTube-to-MP3 Script

BACKGROUND

This is a replacement for the YouTube-To-MP3 websites commonly found on the internet, where one may be bombarded with adware and long wait times. It accepts a URL to a specific YouTube video and extracts the audio, saving it as an MP3 file in a destination of your choosing (or in the root directory if unspecified). This project is written in Python, and is designed to be as efficient, instant, and non-intrusive as possible. It makes use of the dependency pytube to locate and download these videos. Currently, this app is able to work with videos of any length, but does not have the capability to download multiple videos at once (i.e. from a playlist).
